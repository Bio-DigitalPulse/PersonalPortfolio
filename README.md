# PersonalPortfolio

This is a professional portfolio, belonging to Aaron Keller, detailing various accomplishments and deployed projects in software dvelopment.

This code includes proper semantic HTML elements, various CSS calls to support greater functionality, and product cards to further clarify developed projects distrubuted on the web.

Media screens are added to contribute to accessable sizing for various media platforms.

Employed a CSS grid format to finish the project card installation, tweaked it to desired functionality, although lacking adequate URL links to external, these will be added later as projects go live.

Added comments for further clarification on HTML elements.
